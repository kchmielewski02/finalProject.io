# Data Understanding
Our data came from Baseball Reference, which is a website that has play-by-play statistics for every game dating back to the 1960s. We utilized their database to access team batting and pitching statistics for the years 1985-2016.

Our Variables:

yearid: Ordinal

teamid: Interval

game_t: Interval

win_t: Interval

era_t: Ratio

teamname: Nominal

teamOPS: ratio

wswin_t: Nominal

run_t: Interval

hit_t: Interval

hr_t: Interval

bb_t: Interval

so_t: Interval

runallow_t: Interval

earnrun_t: Interval

save_t: Interval

errors_t: Interval

# Data Preperation
To prep for our project, we cleaned that data by dropping variables we didn't need such as some advanced statistics like OPS+ and other irrlevant statistics like CS. All in all we ended up with 918 observations with 17 variables.
